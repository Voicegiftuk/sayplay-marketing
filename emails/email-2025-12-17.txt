SUBJECT: The gift they'll never throw away
PREVIEW: Transform ordinary gifts into treasures

Hi there,

What's the best gift you ever received?

I bet it wasn't the most expensive. It was probably the most thoughtful - something that showed someone really knew you, really cared.

That's what SayPlay is all about.

Imagine giving a birthday gift with a video message of you singing happy birthday. Or a Christmas present where your kids can hear grandma's voice telling her favorite story. Or an anniversary gift where your partner can replay your vows whenever they want.

SayPlay makes it possible. Just £19.99 for a sticker that holds voice or video messages forever. No app needed - recipients just tap with their phone.

Hundreds of families are already using SayPlay to make their gifts unforgettable.
