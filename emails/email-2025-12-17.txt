SUBJECT: The gift everyone wants this Winter
PREVIEW: Make 2025 unforgettable

Hi there,

What if I told you the best gifts of 2025 aren't things at all?

They're moments. Voices. Memories that last forever.

With Christmas (8 days) coming up, you're probably thinking about gifts. But here's the thing - in Winter 2025, people don't want more stuff. They want connection.

That's exactly what SayPlay gives them.

Imagine: A birthday gift with a video of you singing happy birthday. A Winter present where they can hear your voice telling their favorite story. An anniversary gift where they can replay your message whenever they want.

Just £19.99 for a sticker that holds voice or video messages forever. No app needed.

Hundreds of families are already using SayPlay to make 2025 special.
